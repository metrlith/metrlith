> I fix bugs, listen to music, and pet cats. Sometimes all at once.

## 👤 About Me

Hello! I'm **MetroKitten**, but you can call me **Metr**. I'm a passionate, curious, and sarcastically charming student who loves **coding**, **cats**, and everything in between. I write code, break code, and occasionally cry over broken code — it's a lifestyle.

I spend most of my time juggling Discord bot development, game modding, website design, network troubleshooting, and dealing with scammers. Sometimes, I even pretend I’m not being censored on the internet (thanks, Turkey 😿).

## 🧠 What I Know

**Languages & Tools I Use Regularly:**

* 💻 **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
* 🐍 **Python**
* ☕ **Java** (for Minecraft modding, sometimes)
* 📦 VS Code is my command center
* 🐱 Discord bots, my digital pets

---

## 📌 Notable Projects

* **🎮 [Candy Crush Forever!](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushForever)**
  The mix of 2 Candy Crush tools at once; this project allows you to make mouth-drooling, sugary custom levels for yourself!

* **🌐 Doğanlar Otomotiv Website:**
  Full website redesign with edge-to-edge hero images, particle backgrounds, responsive layout, and FAQ sections for a Subaru-authorized service center. Soon, I will also publish it here!

* **🌍 [Earthquake Alerts Discord Bot](https://github.com/metrlith/Earthquake-Alerts):**
  Real-time alert bot for earthquakes around the world with magnitude/region filters, slash commands, SQLite storage, and an optional `/fakealert` command for fun. It creates hilarious earthquake messages!

* **🔬 Scam Investigations & Geolocation Quizzes:**
  I break down phishing emails, reverse-engineer sketchy sites, and train people on how to spot fakes — all with a flair for memes and mystery 😌

* **🇺🇳 [NationDex](https://github.com/Aram-Development/Nationdex-AA):**
  Ariel Aram has found me suitable for the honorable position of being one of the main developers of NationDex! After 1 year of downtime, the bot is back online!

## 🌐 Interests

* 🧠 **Cybersecurity** and **censorship circumvention** (WARPing)
* 🌍 Digital geography & transportation (Istanbul rail maps, route planning)
* 🎮 Games I love: DELTARUNE, ASTRONEER, Minecraft, Haste — especially when I can hack/mod them 😼😼
* 🐈 Cats. Obviously.
* 📡 Bypassing weird tech limitations because *TO FIGHT THE SYSTEM!!! AHAHAHAHA!!!!!*

---

## 💬 Fun Facts

* I once *inspected a phishing email’s source code in real-time*, edited it and kept a scammer talking for days. That's dedication!! 👀
* I can recognize Istanbul neighborhoods by **satellite images**, you can even find me in Istanbul at any random time (and at any random place). If you want to meet me... 😼
* I maintain *more Discord slash commands than some bots have users.*
* I created a fake earthquake in Discord. Just to see how it would look. 🔥🌍

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

* Expanding the Earthquake bot into a **full mobile app**
* Refactoring open-source bots to actually work and not scream at me with type errors
* Adding even *more* flair and structure to the Candy Crush Editor
* Wishing my friends would stop ghosting me and reply faster 🙄

---

## 📬 Contact

I live in Istanbul, but the best way to find me is through Discord (if it’s not blocked again). You can contact me [via my profile.](https://discord.com/users/877557616094638112)

I'm always down to talk tech, projects, or play games!
