## 👤 About Me

Hai! I'm **MetroKitten**, but you can call me **Metr**. I'm a passionate, sarcastic and determined student who loves **coding**, **cats**, and everything in between. It's a lifestyle~

I spend most of my time bouncing between Discord bot development, normal development, website design and network troubleshooting. Sometimes, I even pretend I’m not being censored on the internet (thanks, Turkiye 😿).

## 🧠 What I Know

**Languages & Tools I Use Regularly:**

* 💻 **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
* 🐍 **Python**
* 📦 VS Code is my command center (it's good)
* 🐱 Discord bots, my digital pets

---

## 📌 Notable Projects

* **🎮 [Candy Crush Forever!](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushForever)**
It's a mix of 2 tools; an editor and a web player that allows you to make your own Candy Crush levels! I know you always imagined about this one 😉

* **🚙 [Doğanlar Otomotiv Website](https://github.com/Doganlar-Otomotiv/DoganlarWebsite):**
the original website was made with a site editor (which is heavy on resources), that wasn't even well made. This one, it's custom coded with a simpler and more sleek design, that's practically the same with the old one!

* **🌍 [Earthquake Alerts Discord Bot](https://github.com/metrlith/Earthquake-Alerts):**
real-time alert bot for earthquakes around the world with magnitude/region filters, slash commands, SQLite storage, and sample message testing. It pulls information from USGS earthquake feeds.

* **🇺🇳 [NationDex](https://github.com/Aram-Development/Nationdex-AA):**
Ariel Aram has found me suitable for the honorable position of being one of the main developers of NationDex! After 1 year of downtime, the bot is back online (and it's being rewritten by me 🤫)

* **🌐 [File Sandbox](https://github.com/metrlith/File-Sandbox)**
it's my latest project. My mission is to discover every file extension out there. A file extension, for example, is: `.md`, `.js`, `.py`, `.ts`, etc... Surely it will be hard, but I accept contributions!

## 🤔 Interests

* 🧠 **Cybersecurity** and **censorship circumvention** (WARPing)
* 🌍 Digital geography & transportation (Istanbul rail maps, route planning [because I travel too much])
* 🎮 Games I love: DELTARUNE, ASTRONEER, Minecraft, Haste, Terraria... (I don't mod games or tamper with save files anymore.)
* 🐈 Cats. Obviously.
* 📡 Bypassing weird tech limitations because *TO FIGHT THE SYSTEM!!!*

---

## 💬 Fun Facts

* I once inspected a phishing e-mail's content and wrote one that was similar to it, and sent it back. The convo kept going for days until they give up 🙏
* I can recognize Istanbul neighborhoods by **satellite images**, you can even find me in Istanbul at any random time (and at any random place, because again, I travel too much).
* I maintain *more Discord slash commands than some bots have users.*
* I created a fake earthquake in Discord. Just to see how it would look. 9.9M earthquake in South Georgia And the South Sandwich Islands 🔥🌍

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

* Expanding the Earthquake bot into a **full mobile app**
* Adding more files to the File Sandbox
* Adding even *more* flair and structure to the Candy Crush Editor
* Wishing my friends would stop ghosting me and reply faster 🙄
