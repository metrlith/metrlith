# Hey there, I'm Metr (aka metrokitten, metrlith... and more)

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a programmer, coding with different languages (with limited knowledge).

## 🚀 Projects I'm proud of
- 🎮 [**CandyCrushLevelEditor**](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushLevelEditor) – A creative tool for designing your own Candy Crush levels! Built with my friend Blaki.
- 📚 [**eTwinning-Knowledge-Base**](https://github.com/metrlith/eTwinning-Knowledge-Base) – A simple, helpful resource to explain eTwinning and Twinspace (because the EU sure didn’t).

## 💻 Favorite Tech
I enjoy working with:
- `Markdown` – for writing clean, structured docs
- `HTML` – for building expressive, simple web pages
- `Java` - for making Minecraft mods

## 🎧 Music keeps me going
Coding without music? Couldn’t be me.
I'm always listening — especially Turkish pop (Hadise/İrem Derici). Feel free to send recs!
