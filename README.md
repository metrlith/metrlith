# Hey there, I'm Metr (aka metrokitten, metrlith... and more names)

Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm a very cute 17 years old Turkish programmer cat :3

## ðŸš€ Projects I'm proud of
- ðŸŽ® [**CandyCrushLevelEditor**](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushLevelEditor): A creative tool for designing your own Candy Crush levels! Made with Blaki, my friend.
- ðŸ“š [**eTwinning-Knowledge-Base**](https://github.com/metrlith/eTwinning-Knowledge-Base): A simple, yet educational place to learn how to use eTwinning and Twinspace (because the EU did not make it clear!)

## ðŸ’» Favorite Tech
I enjoy working with:
- `Markdown` â€” for writing clean, structured docs
- `HTML` â€” for building simple, expressive web pages

## ðŸŽ§ Music keeps me going
Coding without music? Couldn't be me.  
Feel free to recommend me something â€” I'm always listening (Turkish pop lelelelelelele)

## ðŸ’¬ Say hi!
- Discord: `_metr_` (DM me if you wanna chat about projects or music)

ðŸŒ€ This is a mix of fun and function â€” just like my life.
